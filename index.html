      <h1>Children of God, Shalom!</h1>
      <p>I am a Quality Engineer on the road to Damascus. Nine months of training, I was born amphibious in Kumasi, Ghana.
        Twenty-three hours of the day, you'll find me Reading, Researching or Running because an investment in knowledge
        always pays the best intrest. In a year or less, by God grace, I will be a Software Developer for a Fortune 100 
        company like Google, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, etc and retire my parents. In my fathers house, there are many 
        mansions but you'll find me at the Guy Fawkes Estate dripping with potential. Currently, my mother is sitting next
        to me doing konkonsa on my code. Lets chat soon!
