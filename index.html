      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a Quality Engineer on the road to Damascus. Nine months of training, I was born amphibious in Kumasi, Ghana.
        Twenty-three hours of the day, you'll find me Reading, Researching or Running because an investment in knowledge
        always pays the best intrest. In a year, by God grace, I will be a Software Developer for a Fortune 100 company like Google, 
        Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, etc and retire my parents. In my fathers house, there are many mansions but you'll find me at the 
        Guy Fawkes Estate dripping with potential. Lets chat soon!
